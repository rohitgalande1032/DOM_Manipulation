Project Goals:

Implement the functionality:
Increase the count by 1 when the "increment" button is clicked.
Decrease the count by 1 when the "decrement" button is clicked.
Set the count to 0 and hide the "clear" button when clicked, if the count is 0.
Show an error message in red if the count is already 0 and the "decrement" button is clicked.

UI Overview: The UI consists of three buttons: "increment", "decrement", and "clear", along with a middle div to display the count. When the "increment" button is clicked, the count increases by 1. Similarly, clicking the "decrement" button decreases the count by 1. The "clear" button resets the count to 0 and hides itself if the count is already 0.
