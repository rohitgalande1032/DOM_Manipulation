Project Goals:

Design the UI as shown in the diagram.
Edit the DOM elements accordingly.
Implement the functionality:
Increase the count by 1 when the "increment" button is clicked.
Decrease the count by 1 when the "decrement" button is clicked.
Set the count to 0 and hide the "clear" button when clicked, if the count is 0.
Show an error message in red if the count is already 0 and the "decrement" button is clicked.
